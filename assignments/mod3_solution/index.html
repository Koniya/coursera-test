        <h4> Chicken Tips and Techniques</h4>

        <h4>Safety:</h4>
        <p>Always wash hands, preparation surfaces, and utensils in hot, soapy water before and after contact with raw chicken. Never allow cooked chicken to sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours. If it is not eaten immediately, cooked chicken should be kept hot or refrigerated.</p>

        <h4>Thawing:</h4>
        <p>Thaw chicken in the refrigerator, in the microwave, or under cold running water - never on the countertop at room temperature, which provides bacteria with an ideal temperature to grow. When thawing chicken in the refrigerator, be sure to place the raw chicken on a plate on the bottom shelf to prevent the raw juices from dripping onto other foods or refrigerator surfaces.</p>

        <h4>Cutting:</h4>
        <p>Cutting boneless skinless chicken breasts into pieces can be a slippery task. Make it safer and prevent the knife from slipping by cutting the chicken while it is partially frozen. The firmer chicken is much easier to cut and handle.</p>

        <h4>Storing:</h4>
        <p>Packaged fresh chicken should be refrigerated in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Freeze uncooked chicken if it is not to be used within 2 days. If properly packaged, frozen chicken will maintain top quality in a home freezer for up to 6 months.</p>

        <h4>Freezing:</h4>
        <p>If you use boneless, skinless chicken breasts often in recipes, package them for the freezer in recipe-size portions. This lets you thaw only the amount you need and prevents extra pieces of raw chicken, which are very perishable, from spoiling.</p>

        <h4>Cooking:</h4>
        <p>Always cook chicken until well done, not medium or rare. When checking poultry for doneness, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh (taking care to avoid any bones) and the thickest part of the breast. When the thermometer registers 165°F, the chicken is done. When the chicken is completely cooked, the juices should run clear.</p>

       <h3 class="text-center" id="Beef">Beef</h3>
       <p>Beef varies tremendously in taste and quality depending on the age, breed, diet, lifestyle, slaughter and processing of the animal, so it's wise to choose and cook your meat carefully and to tailor the cut you buy to the dish you want to cook. Aberdeen Angus is a well-known good-quality breed of beef, but there are dozens of other breeds native to Britain or established for centuries. Native breeds include the Welsh Black, Highland, Lincoln Red, South Devon, Sussex and Hereford. Rare British breeds cover the Irish Moiled, Beef Shorthorn, Belted and Black Galloways, Red Poll, White Park, British White, Longhorn, Gloucester and Dexter.</p>

        <h4>Buyer's Guide</h4>

        <p>Look for beef that's firm to the touch. Avoid wet, slimy meat and meat with a greenish-grey tinge and an 'off' smell. Always check the 'use by' dates on pre-packed meat.</p>

        <p>Colour is often cited as a means of determining the quality of beef, but it can't be used as the main indicator of quality. In general, meat that has been matured traditionally ('dry-aged') will tend to be deep burgundy in colour with creamy, yellowish fat. Meat that has been vacuum-packed shortly after slaughter will retain a bright-red appearance with white fat. This meat can still be tender but may lack the complexity of flavour of traditionally dry-aged beef. Brown colouring indicates the meat has been open to the air for too long. Most of the meat sold in supermarkets will be vacuum-packed and is seldom dry-aged for any length of time.</p>

        <p>Many people prefer beef that's 'marbled' (flecked throughout) with fat. Marbled meat is considered to be more flavoursome and tender because the fat lubricates the meat during cooking and adds another layer of flavour. However leaner meat needn't be lacking in flavour if cooked properly.</p>

        <p>Butchers are likely to stock a greater variety of cuts than most supermarkets and should be able to give advice on preparing and cooking, as well as telling you where, and from which breeds, their meat came from and for how long it has been aged. This level of detail should also be available from producers at farmers' markets and mail-order companies specialising in meat.</p>

        <p>For organically-raised beef - or beef from breeds noted for their succulent meat, such as Aberdeen Angus - you should be prepared to pay more. Regardless, buying the best quality beef you can afford is always worthwhile.</p>

       <h3 class="text-center" id="Sushi">Sushi</h3>
       <p>As many ingredients that are used, there is also just as many ways to prepare and assemble those ingredients. This page goes through the ways of preparing sushi. However when it comes to ordering these types, it is simply not as simple as saying what "type" of sushi you want, as each type has it's variations and possble ingredients. So if you want Nigiri, you will need to tell your sushi chef (Itamae-san) what you want it made of such as tuna, salmon, yellow tail, etc. Same thing applies to ordering other types of sushi as well.

        Note that in word combinations in which "sushi" is the second word "sushi" becomes "zushi". Example: Makizushi</p>

        <h4> Chicken Tips and Techniques</h4>

        <h4>Makizushi (rolled sushi)</h4>
        <p>The most comon rolled type of sushi is maki. Usually a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a woven bamboo mat, called a makisu. Makizushi is the form of sushi with which many Westerners are most familiar. Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori, a sheet of dried seaweed that encloses the rice and fillings. There are other forms of rolled sushi that are all in the maki family as described below.</p>

        <h4>Futomaki (large rolls)</h4>
        <p>A large cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. Typical futomaki are two or three centimeters thick and four or five centimeters wide. They are often made with two or three fillings, chosen for their complementary taste and color.</p>

        <h4>Hosomaki (thin rolls)</h4>
        <p>A small cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. Typical hosomaki are about two centimeters thick and two centimeters wide. They are generally made with only one filling, simply because there is not enough room for more than one.</p>

        <h4>Temaki (hand rolls)</h4>
        <p>A large cone-shaped piece, with the nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki is about ten centimeters long, and is eaten with the fingers since it is too awkward to pick up with chopsticks.</p>

        <h4>Uramaki (inside-out rolls)</h4>
        <p>A medium-sized cylindrical piece, with two or more fillings. Uramaki differ from other maki because the rice is on the outside and the nori within. The filling is in the center surrounded by a liner of nori, then a layer of rice, and an outer coating of some other ingredient such as roe or toasted sesame seeds.</p>
