        <p>We’ve got everything you need to know about chicken right here, plus some of the best chicken recipes collections, including chicken stir-fry recipes, grilled chicken recipes and Healthy Living chicken recipes. Check out these tips and tricks for buying, storing, and cooking chicken, and maybe whip up a delicious chicken caesar salad while you're at it! </p>

        <h4> Chicken Tips and Techniques</h4>

        <h4>Safety:</h4>
        <p>Always wash hands, preparation surfaces, and utensils in hot, soapy water before and after contact with raw chicken. Never allow cooked chicken to sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours. If it is not eaten immediately, cooked chicken should be kept hot or refrigerated.</p>

        <h4>Thawing:</h4>
        <p>Thaw chicken in the refrigerator, in the microwave, or under cold running water - never on the countertop at room temperature, which provides bacteria with an ideal temperature to grow. When thawing chicken in the refrigerator, be sure to place the raw chicken on a plate on the bottom shelf to prevent the raw juices from dripping onto other foods or refrigerator surfaces.</p>

        <h4>Cutting:</h4>
        <p>Cutting boneless skinless chicken breasts into pieces can be a slippery task. Make it safer and prevent the knife from slipping by cutting the chicken while it is partially frozen. The firmer chicken is much easier to cut and handle.</p>

        <h4>Storing:</h4>
        <p>Packaged fresh chicken should be refrigerated in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Freeze uncooked chicken if it is not to be used within 2 days. If properly packaged, frozen chicken will maintain top quality in a home freezer for up to 6 months.</p>

        <h4>Freezing:</h4>
        <p>If you use boneless, skinless chicken breasts often in recipes, package them for the freezer in recipe-size portions. This lets you thaw only the amount you need and prevents extra pieces of raw chicken, which are very perishable, from spoiling.</p>

        <h4>Cooking:</h4>
        <p>Always cook chicken until well done, not medium or rare. When checking poultry for doneness, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh (taking care to avoid any bones) and the thickest part of the breast. When the thermometer registers 165°F, the chicken is done. When the chicken is completely cooked, the juices should run clear.</p>

       <h3 class="menu-title text-center">Beef</h3>
       <p>Beef varies tremendously in taste and quality depending on the age, breed, diet, lifestyle, slaughter and processing of the animal, so it's wise to choose and cook your meat carefully and to tailor the cut you buy to the dish you want to cook. Aberdeen Angus is a well-known good-quality breed of beef, but there are dozens of other breeds native to Britain or established for centuries. Native breeds include the Welsh Black, Highland, Lincoln Red, South Devon, Sussex and Hereford. Rare British breeds cover the Irish Moiled, Beef Shorthorn, Belted and Black Galloways, Red Poll, White Park, British White, Longhorn, Gloucester and Dexter.</p>

        <h4>Buyer's Guide</h4>

        <p>Look for beef that's firm to the touch. Avoid wet, slimy meat and meat with a greenish-grey tinge and an 'off' smell. Always check the 'use by' dates on pre-packed meat.</p>

        <p>Colour is often cited as a means of determining the quality of beef, but it can't be used as the main indicator of quality. In general, meat that has been matured traditionally ('dry-aged') will tend to be deep burgundy in colour with creamy, yellowish fat. Meat that has been vacuum-packed shortly after slaughter will retain a bright-red appearance with white fat. This meat can still be tender but may lack the complexity of flavour of traditionally dry-aged beef. Brown colouring indicates the meat has been open to the air for too long. Most of the meat sold in supermarkets will be vacuum-packed and is seldom dry-aged for any length of time.</p>

        <p>Many people prefer beef that's 'marbled' (flecked throughout) with fat. Marbled meat is considered to be more flavoursome and tender because the fat lubricates the meat during cooking and adds another layer of flavour. However leaner meat needn't be lacking in flavour if cooked properly.</p>

        <p>Butchers are likely to stock a greater variety of cuts than most supermarkets and should be able to give advice on preparing and cooking, as well as telling you where, and from which breeds, their meat came from and for how long it has been aged. This level of detail should also be available from producers at farmers' markets and mail-order companies specialising in meat.</p>

        <p>For organically-raised beef - or beef from breeds noted for their succulent meat, such as Aberdeen Angus - you should be prepared to pay more. Regardless, buying the best quality beef you can afford is always worthwhile.</p>

        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>Beef will keep for up to five days in the fridge, depending on how fresh it is when you buy it. Mince and offal are best eaten within two days. Vacuum-packed meat will normally last even longer, but check the use-by date to be sure.</p>

        <p>Quickly freezing beef reduces the chance of damage to the texture of the meat. Use frozen beef within six months. Defrost, loosely wrapped, in the fridge allowing five hours per 450g (1lb). Never let the meat or its juices come into contact with other foods in the fridge, particularly ready-to-eat foods.</p>

        <p>If you've cooked beef for eating later, cool it as quickly as possible (within 90 minutes), cover and refrigerate and eat within two days. Do not place hot into the fridge, which would risk raising the temperature of other foods that need to be kept cold.</p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>The larger the joint, the better it is for a traditional British roast. Choose a joint from the back, ribs, fillet or sirloin. Traditional roasting cuts are the forerib (known as rib of beef) or sirloin. Leaving in the bone adds flavour, and bone is a good conductor of heat so the meat will cook more evenly with the bone in. However, a boned and rolled cut is easier to carve.</p>

        <p>A 2.5kg/5½lb joint of beef on the bone (or 1.5kg/3lb 5oz boned and rolled joint) will feed six people generously. Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. For an extra flavoursome roast sear the beef in a hot pan for about 10 minutes before roasting (if you don't sear it first then add an extra 10 minutes to the following cooking times). Roast for 11 minutes per 450g/1lb (for rare), 14 minutes per 450g/1lb (for medium), and 16 minutes per 450g/1lb (for well done).</p>

        <p>To be sure your meat is cooked you can use a meat thermometer. There are two varieties available - one you insert in the thickest part of the raw joint and cook until the desired internal temperature is reached. The other is inserted into the cooked joint after roasting. Recommended temperatures for beef are: Rare 60C; medium 70C; well done 80C. Baste the meat with the juices at least three times during cooking. When it's done, take out the meat and leave it to rest for at least 20 minutes. This enables the joint to re-absorb the delicious juices that have bubbled up and makes it easier to carve.</p>

        <p>Brisket, thick flank, topside and silverside are all good cuts for braising or pot-roasting. The meat is usually dusted with flour and fried first to brown it, then placed on vegetables and herbs; stock is poured in to cover the meat. It's then cooked on a gentle heat in the oven with the lid on. The meat and vegetable juices combine to make a delicious sauce.</p>

        <p>Stewing or casseroling is best for cheaper cuts that need long, gentle cooking such as shin and leg, brisket, chuck and blade, neck and clod and skirt. Many supermarkets sell packets of "stewing steak" that's likely to originate from the tougher cuts and which need longer cooking than cubes of "braising steak".</p>

       <h3 class="menu-title text-center">Sushi</h3>
       <p>As many ingredients that are used, there is also just as many ways to prepare and assemble those ingredients. This page goes through the ways of preparing sushi. However when it comes to ordering these types, it is simply not as simple as saying what "type" of sushi you want, as each type has it's variations and possble ingredients. So if you want Nigiri, you will need to tell your sushi chef (Itamae-san) what you want it made of such as tuna, salmon, yellow tail, etc. Same thing applies to ordering other types of sushi as well.

        Note that in word combinations in which "sushi" is the second word "sushi" becomes "zushi". Example: Makizushi</p>

        <h4> Chicken Tips and Techniques</h4>

        <h4>Makizushi (rolled sushi)</h4>
        <p>The most comon rolled type of sushi is maki. Usually a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a woven bamboo mat, called a makisu. Makizushi is the form of sushi with which many Westerners are most familiar. Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori, a sheet of dried seaweed that encloses the rice and fillings. There are other forms of rolled sushi that are all in the maki family as described below.</p>

        <h4>Futomaki (large rolls)</h4>
        <p>A large cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. Typical futomaki are two or three centimeters thick and four or five centimeters wide. They are often made with two or three fillings, chosen for their complementary taste and color.</p>

        <h4>Hosomaki (thin rolls)</h4>
        <p>A small cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. Typical hosomaki are about two centimeters thick and two centimeters wide. They are generally made with only one filling, simply because there is not enough room for more than one.</p>

        <h4>Temaki (hand rolls)</h4>
        <p>A large cone-shaped piece, with the nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki is about ten centimeters long, and is eaten with the fingers since it is too awkward to pick up with chopsticks.</p>

        <h4>Uramaki (inside-out rolls)</h4>
        <p>A medium-sized cylindrical piece, with two or more fillings. Uramaki differ from other maki because the rice is on the outside and the nori within. The filling is in the center surrounded by a liner of nori, then a layer of rice, and an outer coating of some other ingredient such as roe or toasted sesame seeds.</p>

        <h4>Oshizushi (pressed sushi)</h4>
        <p>A block-shaped piece formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the topping, covers it with sushi rice, and presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and cut into bite-sized pieces.</p>

        <h4>Nigirizushi (hand-formed sushi)</h4>
        <p>Small pieces nominally similar to pressed sushi or rolled sushi, but made without using a makisu or oshibako. Assembling nigirizushi is surprisingly difficult to do well. The simplest form is a small block of sushi rice with a speck of wasabi and a thin slice of a topping draped over it, possibly tied up with a thin band of nori.</p>

        <h4>Gunkanzushi (battleship roll)</h4>
        <p>A small, oval-shaped piece, similar in size and appearance to hosomaki. A clump of rice is hand-wrapped in a strip of nori, but instead of a filling in the center, it has some ingredient such as fish eggs piled on top.</p>

        <h4>Inarizushi (stuffed sushi)</h4>
        <p>A small pouch or pocket filled with sushi rice and other ingredients. The pouch is fashioned from deep-fried tofu (abura age), a thin omelet (fukusazushi), or cabbage leaves (kanpyo).</p>

        <h4>Chirashizushi (scattered sushi)</h4>
        <p>A bowl of sushi rice with the other ingredients mixed in. Also referred to as barazushi.</p>

        <h4>Edomae Chirashizushi (Edo-style scattered sushi)</h4>
        <p>Uncooked ingredients artfully arranged on top of the rice in the bowl.</p>
